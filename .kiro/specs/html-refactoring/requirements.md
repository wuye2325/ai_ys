# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This project aims to refactor a large, monolithic HTML file (index.html) that contains a discussion forum interface. The current file is over 2000 lines and contains mixed HTML structure, inline styles, embedded JavaScript, and hardcoded content. The goal is to break this down into a modular, maintainable, and scalable codebase following modern web development best practices.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the HTML structure to be modular and component-based, so that I can easily maintain and update individual parts of the interface.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the refactoring is complete THEN the system SHALL have separate HTML files for each major component (navbar, discussion section, comment components)
2. WHEN a component needs to be updated THEN the developer SHALL be able to modify only that specific component file
3. WHEN new components are added THEN they SHALL follow the established modular structure
4. WHEN components are reused THEN they SHALL be easily includable in multiple pages

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all JavaScript functionality to be externalized and organized, so that I can debug and enhance features more efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the refactoring is complete THEN all inline JavaScript SHALL be moved to separate .js files
2. WHEN JavaScript functions are organized THEN they SHALL be grouped by functionality (comments, UI interactions, data handling)
3. WHEN the page loads THEN all JavaScript functionality SHALL work exactly as before
4. WHEN debugging is needed THEN developers SHALL be able to locate specific functions quickly

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all styling to be properly organized and maintainable, so that I can easily update the visual design without affecting functionality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the refactoring is complete THEN all inline styles SHALL be moved to CSS files
2. WHEN CSS is organized THEN it SHALL be split into logical modules (layout, components, utilities)
3. WHEN styles need updates THEN developers SHALL be able to modify specific CSS modules
4. WHEN the page renders THEN the visual appearance SHALL be identical to the original

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the content to be separated from the structure, so that I can easily update content without modifying HTML templates.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the refactoring is complete THEN hardcoded content SHALL be moved to data files (JSON/JS)
2. WHEN content needs updates THEN developers SHALL be able to modify data files without touching HTML
3. WHEN the page loads THEN content SHALL be dynamically populated from data sources
4. WHEN new content is added THEN it SHALL follow the established data structure

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the project to have a clear file structure and build process, so that I can easily understand and work with the codebase.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the refactoring is complete THEN the project SHALL have a logical directory structure
2. WHEN developers join the project THEN they SHALL be able to understand the structure from documentation
3. WHEN files are modified THEN the build process SHALL automatically update the final output
4. WHEN the project is deployed THEN all assets SHALL be properly linked and functional

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the refactored code to maintain all existing functionality, so that users experience no disruption during the transition.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the refactoring is complete THEN all interactive features SHALL work identically to the original
2. WHEN users interact with the interface THEN all buttons, forms, and animations SHALL respond as expected
3. WHEN the page loads THEN all content SHALL display correctly across different devices
4. WHEN accessibility features are tested THEN they SHALL meet the same standards as the original
