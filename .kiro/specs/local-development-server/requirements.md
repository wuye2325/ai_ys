# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature addresses the CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) policy issues that occur when running HTML applications locally using the file:// protocol. The current application fails to load JavaScript modules and other resources when opened directly in a browser due to browser security restrictions. This feature will provide a local development server solution that allows the application to run properly during development and testing.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to run the HTML application locally without CORS errors, so that I can test and develop the application effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a developer runs the application locally THEN the system SHALL serve files over HTTP protocol instead of file:// protocol
2. WHEN JavaScript modules are loaded THEN the system SHALL allow cross-origin requests within the local development environment
3. WHEN the application starts THEN all CSS, JavaScript, and JSON resources SHALL load successfully without CORS errors

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a simple command to start a local development server, so that I can quickly begin development work.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a developer runs a start command THEN the system SHALL launch a local HTTP server
2. WHEN the server starts THEN the system SHALL automatically open the application in the default browser
3. WHEN the server is running THEN the system SHALL display the server URL and port information
4. WHEN the developer stops the server THEN the system SHALL cleanly shut down all server processes

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the development server to support live reloading, so that I can see changes immediately without manual refresh.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a file is modified THEN the system SHALL automatically reload the browser page
2. WHEN CSS files are changed THEN the system SHALL update styles without full page reload when possible
3. WHEN JavaScript files are modified THEN the system SHALL reload the affected modules
4. WHEN HTML files are updated THEN the system SHALL refresh the page to show changes

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the server to handle different file types correctly, so that all application resources load with proper MIME types.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN serving HTML files THEN the system SHALL set Content-Type to text/html
2. WHEN serving CSS files THEN the system SHALL set Content-Type to text/css
3. WHEN serving JavaScript files THEN the system SHALL set Content-Type to application/javascript
4. WHEN serving JSON files THEN the system SHALL set Content-Type to application/json
5. WHEN serving image files THEN the system SHALL set appropriate image MIME types

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the development server to be lightweight and easy to set up, so that it doesn't add complexity to the development workflow.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN setting up the server THEN the system SHALL require minimal configuration
2. WHEN installing dependencies THEN the system SHALL use commonly available tools or minimal additional packages
3. WHEN running the server THEN the system SHALL have low resource usage
4. WHEN the project is shared THEN other developers SHALL be able to start the server with a single command
